			<h2>Mobile Legends Division</h2>
			<p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is an MOBA game designed for mobile phones. The two opposing teams struggle to reach and destroy the enemy base while maintaining their own base to control the path, three "paths" known as "top", "middle" and "bottom", which connect the bases.</p>
			<p>On each team, there are five players who each control an avatar, known as a "hero", from their own devices. Weaker computer-controlled characters, called "minions", lay eggs at the base of the team and follow three paths to the opposing team's base, fighting enemies and towers.</p>

			<h2>PUBG Mobile Division</h2>
			<p>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an online multiplayer battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. The game is based on previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round. And PUBGM is the mobile version of PUBG pc and consol</p>
